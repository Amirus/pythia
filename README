Pythia is a web frontend for the Go source code oracle, which is a source
code comprehension tool for Go programs.

For more information on the Go oracle, see the original announcement:

Pythia requires a recent (=tip) version of the GOROOT libraries.

To install, run
  go get github.com/fzipp/pythia

You will now find a 'pythia' binary in your $GOPATH/bin directory.
Start the web application with a package path, e.g.:

  pythia net/http

By default it will listen on port :8080 and try to launch the application
in your browser. You can choose a different port via the -http flag, e.g.:

  pythia -http=:6060 fmt

Run 'pythia -help' for more information.
